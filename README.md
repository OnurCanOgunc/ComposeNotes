## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

**Core Technologies:**

*   **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for Android development, offering modern syntax, null safety, and coroutines for efficient and secure code.That's why it was chosen.
*   **Jetpack Compose:** Android's modern, declarative UI toolkit. Simplifies UI development with composable functions and reactive updates. Chosen for its modern approach and improved UI performance.

**Data Persistence:**

*   **Room Database:** Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, making local data storage and management easier and safer. Chosen for efficient local data storage and ease of use.

**Dependency Injection:**

*   **Dagger Hilt:** Simplifies dependency injection, reducing boilerplate code and improving code organization and testability. Chosen for efficient dependency management and improved testability.

**Navigation:**

*   **Navigation Compose:** A tool used for managing in-app navigation with Jetpack Compose. It simplifies screen transitions, parameter passing, and managing the navigation graph.

**Architecture:**

*   **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** Separates UI (View) from business logic (ViewModel), improving testability, maintainability, and code organization.Chosen for its widely recognized benefits in structuring Android apps.
*   **Clean Architecture:** Â Organizes the app into layers (Presentation, Domain, Data) to enforce separation of concerns and improve long-term maintainability and scalability. Chosen for its robust structure and improved code organization.

**Concurrency:**

*   **Coroutines:** It simplifies asynchronous programming in Kotlin, making it easier to write efficient and readable concurrent code. It was chosen for its performance and simplified asynchronous coding.
*   **Flow:** A reactive programming library used to handle asynchronous data streams and respond to data changes over time. It was chosen for its ability to manage asynchronous data processing and ensure UI responsiveness.
